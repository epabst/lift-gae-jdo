What is This?
==============
This Liftweb application will demonstrate how to manage
owned One-to-Many relation on Google App Engine for Java
through the JDO2 interface.  The code has been based on 
Derek Chen-Becker's JPADemo[1][2].


How to Try
==========
Before the compilation, a step is needed to be done.
  1. Set your application name on GAE/J to
       'src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml' file.

Now, you are ready to run or upload this liftweb application to GAE/J.

  $ mvn gae:deploy
    or
  $ mvn gae:run
  
See http://www.kindleit.net/maven_gae_plugin/plugin-info.html for more info.


Notes
=====
  * Entity models are defined in com.jcraft.lift.model package.
  * This program defines two models; Author and Book, and they are
    detachable.  Refer to those source code.
  * Author includes many instances of Book.
  * DetachOnClose and DatachOnCommit has been enabled by the default.
    Refer to 'src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/jdconfig.xml'
  * Without definitions for indexes, objects in One-to-Many relation
    must not be persisted.
    Refer to 'src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/datastore-indexes.xml'
  * The package org.scala_libs.jdo is the scala wrapper for JDO2 APIs.


TODO
====
  * org.scala_libs.jdo package should be independently released and
    provided as scalajdo.
 

Enjoy!
